            <p>Cambridge University Volleyball Club (CUVC) is dedicated to playing and promoting volleyball of all levels at the University of Cambridge. CUVC is also a community, bringing together all those at the University with a shared passion for Volleyball.<br>
               <br>
               On the competitive side, we have first (“Blues”) and second teams for both Men and Women, which all participate in the British Universities &amp; Colleges Sport (BUCS) leagues and cups. Every year we also compete in Varsity Matches against Oxford. Although we are most committed to Indoor Volleyball, we have plenty of avid Beachers in the club who organize Beach Volleyball Sessions and participate in Beach Volleyball tournaments, such as the Beach Volleyball Student Cup, in Easter Term.&nbsp;<br>
               <br>
               If you are a volleyball lover but do not want to commit, or haven’t engaged in competitive Volleyball before, there are still plenty of opportunities at CUVC. In Michaelmas Term, we have Beginners Sessions, where Club members teach volleyball basics to anyone interested in learning. Through Lent Term, CUVC organizes College Cuppers, which allows enthusiasts to engage in the sport without massive commitment, participating in a fun-driven competition between the Cambridge Colleges.<br>
               <br>
               Beginner or seasoned veteran, If you are keen to play with CUVC, see the <a href="/prospective-players.php">‘Prospective Players’ section</a> on how to join the club!
