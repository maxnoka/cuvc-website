               <p><b>Beginning of the Season</b><br>
                  At the beginning of Michaelmas term trials will be held to make an initial selection for the Men’s and Women's Blues (1st teams) and 2nd teams. As of now, sign-ups are now open for all prospective players!<br>
                  <br>
                  Because of COVID-19, this year we will not be able to host trials as we normally would. Instead, we will be inviting prospective players to training sessions in small groups based on the information we get from this sign up sheet.<br>
